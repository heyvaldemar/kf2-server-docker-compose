# healthcheck.sh - healthy only when the game itself answers.
#
# Sends A2S_INFO, the Steam server query every server browser sends, to the
# query port inside the container, and exits 0 only on the server's reply.
# Killing Floor 2 answers it through Steam's game-server API inside its own
# process (it answered 6 slots to A2S on the machine this template comes
# from); a stopped or hung server answers nothing.
#
# NOT THE PROCESS. Up to v1.6.8 the check was pgrep for KFGameSteamServer.bin.
# A hung or stopped server keeps its process; the real-server workflow stops
# it with SIGSTOP and requires this check red while that one stays green.
#
# NOT THE LOG. An empty server writes nothing for hours while it is perfectly
# well; it still answers A2S_INFO, which is how a server browser lists it.
#
# A HICCUP (a save, a busy frame) can drop one answer, so one check tries
# twice, a second apart, and Docker's retries cover the rest: three misses in
# a row at the compose file's interval. Every read
# times out after 1.5 seconds (a running server answers in milliseconds);
# with two addresses to try, a silent server costs the whole check 7 seconds,
# inside the 10 Docker gives it.
#
# THE CHALLENGE. Since 2020 Source servers may answer the first A2S_INFO with
# S2C_CHALLENGE ('A' and four bytes); the query is then sent again with those
# bytes appended, and only the info reply ('I') counts.
#
# THE ADDRESS IT ANSWERS ON. The addresses come from /proc/net/udp, every
# socket bound to the game port; no socket there at all is unhealthy at once.
# Bound to one address, that address. Bound to 0.0.0.0 (Left 4 Dead 2), the
# container's own address from /etc/hosts first, then 127.0.0.1: such a
# server did not answer a query sent to 127.0.0.1 (CI, 2026-11-08), and the
# query CI had always sent went to the container's address.
#
# INSIDE THE CONTAINER. This proves the server answers in its own network
# namespace. It does not prove the port is published on the host, nor that a
# firewall lets players in.
#
# Usage: healthcheck.sh [query port]   (default 27015). Needs bash, timeout, head,
# od and tr, which the image has (tests/e2e-healthcheck.sh runs it there).
#
# Read whole before it runs: one brace group, ending in exit
# (bash reads a script as it runs it, so a file rewritten under a running
# copy would otherwise run the new text from the middle).
