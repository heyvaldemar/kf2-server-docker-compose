# Does the health check go by the game's own answer, run in the pinned image?
#
# tools/healthcheck.sh sends A2S_INFO, the engine's server query, to the game
# port and is healthy only on the engine's reply. Here it runs in the image
# the compose file pins, so bash, timeout, head, od and tr are proven to be
# there, against a stand-in that speaks just enough A2S
# (tests/fixtures/fake-a2s.py), in the stand-in's network namespace:
#
#   answers     bound to the interface address, as srcds binds it: healthy
#   challenge   S2C_CHALLENGE first, the info reply only to a query carrying
#               its bytes: healthy
#   0.0.0.0     bound to every address and deaf to a query from 127.0.0.1,
#               as Left 4 Dead 2 was in CI: healthy, asked at the
#               container's own address
#   silent      a socket on the port that never answers, on one address and
#               on 0.0.0.0 (two to ask): unhealthy, and the check is over
#               within 8 seconds, inside the 10 Docker gives it
#   no socket   nothing bound to the port, which is a process that stands
#               without a network, as Black Mesa's did on Docker 29.4.2:
#               unhealthy
#
#   the floor   the shipped interval times the retries: a dead server must
#               read unhealthy within a minute (a 60-second interval once left
#               a dead server healthy for three)
#
# The stand-in is not a server. The real one is
# .github/workflows/real-server.yml, which also stops the game process and
# requires the check to go red.
# shellcheck disable=SC2015   # pass and fail always exit 0, so "A && pass || fail" is if-then-else here
